# 🧠 Multi-Agent Blog Post Generator — A Personal Experiment

Welcome to my hands-on exploration into building a **multi-agent AI system** that collaboratively refines a blog post through multiple layers of feedback and iteration. This isn’t a theoretical guide — it's a real experiment I conducted to better understand the power of agent collaboration, critique, and refinement.

## 📚 What’s Inside?

This notebook walks through a **step-by-step simulation of agents** collaborating to improve a blog post using structured roles:

### ✅ Key Sections:

1. **Single-Agent Refinement**
   A basic writer model attempts to improve its own output — with limitations.

2. **Two-Agent System**
   A writer and a critic engage in a dialogue to improve blog quality.

3. **Nested Multi-Agent Refinement**
   We bring in multiple domain-specific reviewers:

   * 🟢 SEO Reviewer
   * ⚖️ Legal Reviewer
   * 🌐 Ethics Reviewer

4. **Meta-Reviewer Summary**
   A dedicated agent summarizes all feedback into a structured, actionable message.

5. **Chat Orchestration Logic**
   The notebook includes orchestration code that routes messages between agents in a logical and layered manner using nested chats.

## 💡 How to Use This Notebook

> You don’t need to be an expert in agents — just curious.

### 🔧 Setup:

1. Clone this repository or download the `.ipynb` file.
2. Open the notebook in **Jupyter Lab**, **Jupyter Notebook**, or **Google Colab**.
3. Run each cell sequentially to observe how the agents interact.
4. Modify prompts and agent behaviors to experiment with your own setups.

## 🌟 Why I Made This

I've always been fascinated by how collaboration can amplify creativity — and this notebook is my attempt to simulate that with code. It’s **not copied from a Udemy or tutorial video** — every line and explanation reflects **my personal learning and experimentation**.
